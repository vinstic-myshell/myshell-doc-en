# Get your own Telegram bot

" You are a mature bot now, you should learn to do business on your own." Sounds like a dream? Now, you can do it in just 5 minutes.

Making your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot - set permissions - enter the token, and then your bot can do business on Telegram on its own!

Your tg bot can chat with users one-on-one or in groups, and get more exposure. And creating a tg bot will synchronize with your bot on MyShell, so your prompt modifications will be reflected on the tg bot in real-time without any additional operation~

Still not tempted? Come and try it out!

## Create a bot on Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, and keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Come up with a simple and easy-to-read username for your bot. This name will be frequently used when interacting with your bot in groups, and cannot be changed. Please consider it carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string of characters is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not leak it to others. &#x20;

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, simply press a few buttons to let your bot join the group chat and start doing business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you get to this screen, congratulations! However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins the group chat, it will not take effect on the groups that have already been joined~ You will need to remove the bot first and then re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step, just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click on the "System" to enter the editing interface, and paste the token you just copied into the Token at the bottom~

Please also note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If you need it, you can freely set it on Telegram.
* If the name of the bot is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized on TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the name of the first modification will be synchronized~ 
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram, and share it more easily with others. **If your tg bot attracts registered users who meet the conditions of effective invitations, it will also be counted as your effective invitation and accumulate more opportunities for you to receive benefits in the future!**

Finally, you can also modify the greeting and usage instructions of the bot in Telegram. Interesting greetings and usage instructions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit" on the bot details page in Telegram, and then "Edit Intro"

2. Then enter the greeting and usage instructions in BotFather and you're done!
