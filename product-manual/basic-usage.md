#### How to use MyShell?

Web version: https://app.myshell.ai. The web version has the most complete features and all bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet or easily register with a Web2 account system or email. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, the lightweight demo can also experience the basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, the following two bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through Web3 wallets, Web2 account systems, or directly through email and verification codes.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH hosted wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Bot Conversation

Currently, text and audio messages can be sent to the bot. The maximum length of a text message is 500 characters, and the maximum duration of an audio message is 90 seconds. The desktop web version can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space bar shortcut key. After the text message is completed, it can be sent by clicking the enter key shortcut.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the bot, you can click the Clear Memory option in Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the message history, it will only clear the bot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
