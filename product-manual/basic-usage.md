* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through Web3 wallets, Web2 account systems, or directly through email and verification code.

After successfully registering through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH hosting wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, text and audio messages can be sent to the robot. The maximum length of a text message is 500 characters, and the maximum duration of an audio message is 90 seconds. The desktop web version can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space bar shortcut key. After the text message is completed, it can be sent by clicking the enter key shortcut.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the bot, you can click the Clear Memory option in Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the message history, it will only clear the robot's memory of the current user.
