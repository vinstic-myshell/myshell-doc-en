# Membership System and Robot Benefits (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system. Users need to consume power to interact with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher privileges to participate in creation in the robot workshop.

MyShell's membership is divided into three categories: regular members, premium members, and Genesis Pass, each corresponding to different robot benefits.
