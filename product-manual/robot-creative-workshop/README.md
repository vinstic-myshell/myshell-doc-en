# Robot Creative Workshop

To create a high-quality robot in MyShell, it only takes a few minutes:

* Define the core: In the "Definition" panel, use the automatic definition function to complete the definition of prompts and other related configurations in one minute.
* Decorate the appearance: In the "Profile" panel, add information such as avatar, introduction, and greeting for your robot.
* Give it a voice: In the "Voice" panel, choose high-quality preset voices or upload a 20-second audio to clone a unique voice.
* Expand the links: In the "Application Software" integration panel, easily deploy your robot on other platforms.

If you pursue the ultimate performance of the robot, "Advanced Definition" will be your paradise:

* Choose a model: You can choose different language models to meet your needs.
* Advanced definition: By editing the prefix and suffix of the prompt, you can greatly improve the performance of the robot.
* External brain: In the "Knowledge Base" panel, you can fill the robot with information in specific fields to help it break through the limitations of language models.
