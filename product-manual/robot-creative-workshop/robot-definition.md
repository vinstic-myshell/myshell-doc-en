# Robot Definition

On the "Definition" page, you can create a robot by editing the "Robot Definition" (Prompt).

To make the robot perform as expected, you usually need to:

* Understand the capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM).
* Be familiar with high-performance Prompt techniques.
  * Different LLMs have different usage techniques. For the currently popular ChatGPT, you can refer to quality resources such as [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).
* Have more than 10 hours of Prompt editing and debugging experience.
* ...and many other efforts.

However, MyShell's powerful Auto-prompt and rich community support can greatly reduce the threshold for creating excellent robots: you can use the "Auto-generate" function to create a high-quality robot in one minute, or explore countless treasures and open-source prompts in the community.

## Auto-generate

Click the "Auto-generate" button to go to the corresponding panel. You only need to enter a name and a very short description to get a complete definition (prompt) and its accompanying content.

Some examples that can be used for auto-generation are as follows:

* Character class

{% hint style="success" %}
Name: Rick Sanchez

Description: Rick Sanchez in R\&M
{% endhint %}

* Game class

{% hint style="success" %}
Name: ExplorationRPG

Description: RPG Game, act as an astronaut landing on an unknown planet.
{% endhint %}

* Tool class

{% hint style="success" %}
Name: JPTranslator

Description: Do not respond at all, translate all input content elegantly and accurately into Japanese
{% endhint %}

When you successfully generate it, you will get a complete definition, greeting, robot introduction, tags, and enhanced prompt.\
You can adjust the generated text content as you like to achieve the best performance of the robot.

If you encounter any problems when using auto-generation, you can seek help from MyShell's Discord server, where active community users will help you solve the problem.
