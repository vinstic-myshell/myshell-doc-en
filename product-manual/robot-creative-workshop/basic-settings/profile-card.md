# Profile Card

The "Profile Card" allows you to modify the external information of your robot, including: avatar, tags, introduction, and greeting message.

After successfully saving your prompt for the first time, the information in your "Profile Card" will be automatically generated, and you can modify it based on this. When you save your prompt later, you will receive a prompt asking if you want to update the information in your "Profile Card" with the new prompt.

### Avatar

You can upload any picture you like as your avatar, which will be the first impression others have of your bot!

Supported file types: JPG, PNG, WEBM

File size: 1MB

### Tags

In MyShell, robots are divided into several categories: language learning, role-playing, games, tools, and NSFW (Not Safe For Work, not suitable for browsing during work hours). When you save your prompt, the system will automatically identify the type of your robot based on the prompt.

In order to ensure that the most accurate information is displayed in the public robot list, we will review the modified tags when the robot is made public. After the review is passed, the tags you modified will be automatically synchronized to the public robot. (This also means that there may be temporary inconsistencies between the tags of your private robot and the tags of the public robot.)

### Introduction

The introduction is the information that others see when they view your robot. It is generated based on your saved prompt. You can use the introduction to introduce the usage of your robot or leave your contact information for feedback and further optimization of the robot~

### Greeting Message

When your robot enters a conversation for the first time or after clearing its memory, it will automatically send the first message. The greeting message supports markdown text and is enabled by default, but you can choose to manually turn it off.
