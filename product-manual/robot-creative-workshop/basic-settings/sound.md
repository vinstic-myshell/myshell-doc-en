# Sound

The sound settings allow your robot to "talk" to others using the voice you like. It is on by default, but you can turn off the sound switch to make the robot reply with pure text messages.

### Quick Voice Cloning

Upload an audio file that is 20 seconds to 3 minutes long, and you can clone anyone's voice. The current version only supports cloning English voices. Accent, speed, emotion cloning, and more language cloning will be available soon!

For the preparation of uploading audio, please refer to the following tips:

* The quality of the audio is more important than the length of the audio. A 20-second to 3-minute audio is enough to produce a realistic cloned voice. Longer time may not significantly improve the effect.
* A good quality audio has the following characteristics: less background noise, a single speaker, and a stable tone and emotion. Therefore, to clone a more similar voice, please ensure the quality of the audio.

After the cloning is completed, you can listen to it. We provide feedback links on the page. If you are not satisfied with the effect, please feel free to give us feedback. We will further optimize our cloning function based on your feedback!
