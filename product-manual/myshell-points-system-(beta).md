# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a member incentive system designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will follow a points season system for task and reward refresh, with each season lasting about 15 days and task refresh and season changes taking place according to the UTC-4 time zone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn massive points by completing tasks, including daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, education bot check-ins, social media participation, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which point earning will temporarily stop and users can redeem the points earned during the season for rich rewards, including power cards, premium membership cards, and even Genesis Passes. Any remaining points can also be used to redeem season-specific medals, which serve as proof of eligibility for future airdrops. Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of each season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* The premium membership card is globally free during this season, and we hope that everyone can earn more membership benefits for themselves while enjoying the free benefits.
* Reward redemption:
  1. Genesis Pass: Creator benefits, more private robots, privileges to public robots, support for using the GPT-4 model for creation, and more benefits! (For those who have obtained the Genesis Pass, please be patient as we will transfer the Pass to your account within 7 days after casting.)
  2. Premium membership card (1 month): Can be redeemed for one month of premium membership (stackable) after membership payment is activated (expected within three months), suitable for ordinary users who are not creators.
  3. S1 Commemorative Medal: A season-exclusive medal that will soon be cast as an NFT and can serve as proof of eligibility for future airdrops.
  4. GPT-4 Chatting Pack (600 power/300 power/150 power): A prop that can be used for one-time charging, exceeding the power limit, especially suitable for scenarios that require a large amount of GPT-4 usage.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)

* More task types and rewards are coming soon!
