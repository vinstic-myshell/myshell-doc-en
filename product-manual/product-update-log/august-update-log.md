1. S4 season has started. Discord and Twitter tasks will be launched within a week. Please also pay attention to the new community activities, fully experience the functions, and provide feedback to earn points. Starting from the S4 season, the pure version of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 will not be included in the popularity ranking and shared interaction points, but you can still get points rewards by inviting new friends through them
2. In order to encourage a good and real competitive environment, we will automatically identify malicious message brushing to obtain points, malicious creation of small accounts to obtain points, malicious brushing of bot rankings, and other phenomena, and restrict the account's point collection, prize redemption, and interaction contribution. If any friends are mistakenly affected, please contact us for appeal in time
3. Message feedback function is now available: you can provide feedback for bot replies, express support for responses you like, and provide more opinions for responses you are not satisfied with. We will also continuously optimize the underlying performance of bots based on everyone's opinions to make them perform better!
4. Invitation system optimization: In order to better help everyone promote, in addition to the points rewards that the inviter will receive, we have also configured 100 GPT 4 chat packs (️⚡️300) as gifts for the invited person. The first 100 accounts registered through the invitation link/invitation code will receive power packs as new user gifts.

2. Overall optimization of Markdown rendering effects
3. Special fonts such as italics, image links, and emojis in greeting messages will no longer be read out
4. Chat records of trial chats in guest mode will also be saved after registration.
