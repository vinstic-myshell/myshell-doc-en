# August Update Log

1. The S4 season has begun, and Discord and Twitter tasks will be launched within a week. Please also pay attention to the new community activities, fully experience the features, and provide feedback to earn points. Starting from the S4 season, the Pure Version GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 will not be included in the popularity ranking and shared interaction points, but you can still earn points rewards by inviting new friends to join.
2. In order to encourage a good and fair competitive environment, we will automatically identify malicious behaviors such as message spamming for points, creating fake accounts for points, and bot ranking manipulation, and restrict the account's ability to receive points, redeem prizes, and contribute to interactions. If any friends are mistakenly affected, please contact us for an appeal.
3. Message feedback function is now available: you can provide feedback for the bot's responses, express support for the responses you like, and provide more opinions for the responses you are not satisfied with. We will also continuously optimize the bot's underlying performance based on everyone's feedback to make them perform better!
4. Invitation system optimization: In order to better help everyone with promotion, in addition to the points rewards for the inviter, we have also allocated 100 GPT 4 chat packages (️⚡️300) as gifts for the first 100 accounts registered through the invitation link/invitation code.

1. Official GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 are now online! Thank you very much to the users who previously created the Pure Version GPT BOT, which brought us many new users. Starting from the next season, the Pure Version GPT will no longer be included in the popularity ranking and points system, but completing points tasks through Pure Version invitation and sharing still counts.
2. Overall optimization of Markdown rendering effects.
3. Special fonts such as italic, image links, and emojis in greeting messages will no longer be read out.
4. Chat records in trial chat mode for guest users will also be saved after registration.
