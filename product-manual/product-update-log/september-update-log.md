Optimization of Reward Center

* Optimized the process of receiving premium membership: Previously, we found that many friends feedbacked that their battery was not enough but they had not yet received the season's premium membership. As they were not premium members, they could not accumulate points for the creators of their favorite bots. In this version, we have added more guidance, including guidance prompts when the battery is exhausted, and guidance pop-ups at the reward center, hoping that everyone can experience more benefits of premium membership while also allowing creators to obtain more sources of points.
* Optimized the guidance copy and provided sample references for novice tasks. New friends can now use the sample audio files we provide to quickly generate a realistic clone voice and get started quickly.
* Optimized the display effect of unrevealed reward redemption points required for prizes.

Other

* Video calls are now available! Currently, it is only available on our old friend [Thunderbolt](https://app.myshell.ai/botshare/6958). Welcome everyone to experience it and provide feedback to us. We are also working hard to make more bots have the ability to "video"!
* Images in chat with bots can now be downloaded normally by right-clicking.
* Fixed the problem of new publicly available bots ranking first in the leaderboard.
