The beta version of the OC Creation Contest is now live! Come and earn points! MyShell Star OC Championship invited three very popular original creators to create three original characters for the contest. We now invite the community to actively participate in their competition. The rules of the competition are as follows:

1. From 2023-9-20 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-9-27 20:00 (UTC-4), you can support your favorite bot and chat on the arena page by investing points.
2. Each user can only invest points in one bot, but can chat with multiple bots.

Based on the actual participation of the event, MyShell will periodically dig up more high-quality bots of different types to participate in the arena, and will also consider changing the invitation system to a registration system, allowing everyone to experience more high-quality bots and enjoy the fun of earning points faster!

Reward Center Optimization

* Optimized the process of receiving premium membership: Previously, we found that many friends feedback that they did not have enough power but still did not receive the season's premium membership. Because they are not premium members, they cannot accumulate points for the creators of their favorite bots. In this version, we have added more guidance, including guidance prompts when the power is exhausted, and guidance pop-ups at the reward center, hoping that everyone can experience more benefits brought by premium membership while also allowing creators to obtain more points.
* Optimized the guidance text and provided sample references for novice tasks. New friends can now use the sample audio files we provide to quickly generate a realistic clone voice and get started quickly.
* Optimized the display effect of unrevealed reward redemption points required.

Other

* Video calls are now available! Currently only available on our old friend [Thunder Movie](https://app.myshell.ai/botshare/6958), welcome everyone to experience and provide feedback to us. We are also working hard to make more bots have the ability to "video"!
* Images in chat with bots can now be downloaded normally by right-clicking.
* Fixed the problem of newly released bots ranking first in the leaderboard.
