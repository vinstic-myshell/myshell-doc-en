The prize exchange for S1 season is now open! (Please note that the recent season is still in the early testing stage, and there may be temporary rule adjustments during the season.)

* S1 points are now locked, and the points accumulated in the past few days will be carried over to S2 (expected to open on the 16th).
* The available prizes include:
  1. Genesis Pass: Creator rights, more private bots, privileges to make bots public, support for using the GPT-4 model in creation, and more benefits! (For those who have obtained the Genesis Pass, please be patient as we will transfer the Pass to your account within 7 days after it is cast.)
  2. Premium Membership Card (1 month): Can be exchanged for 1 month of premium membership (can be stacked) after the membership fee is paid (expected within three months), suitable for non-creators.
  3. S1 Commemorative Medal: A season-exclusive medal that will soon be cast as an NFT and can be used as proof of eligibility for future airdrops.
  4. GPT-4 Chatting Package (600/300/150 power): A prop that can be used for one-time charging, can exceed the power limit, and is especially suitable for scenarios that require a lot of GPT-4 usage.

* Self-created bots now support uploading promotional images (up to 9) and backgrounds, and you can introduce the gameplay examples of your bot in the image wall to make it easier for others to understand your work.
* Public voice audition, voice cloning, and bot chat now support downloading audio locally.
* When chatting with bots, you can now copy the entire text message.
* Prompt protection mechanism optimization.
* The reward center now offers Discord active point redemption! You can connect your Discord account to the platform and receive points based on your activity level. The level is directly related to the number of messages, and the higher the level, the more points you can receive! Use the "/level" command to check your current level and the number of messages needed to level up.

Major update: Reward Center and brand new membership system

* MyShell point system is now online, and we will use the point season system to allow everyone to play and earn on the platform! The first season will start from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). You can earn a massive amount of points by completing tasks in the first 12 days of the season. Although point redemption is not yet available, all task completion rates will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate points when we open point redemption!
* When there are 3 days left in the season, we will open the point redemption store. At the same time, points cannot be earned in the current season, and new points earned from completing tasks will be accumulated for redemption in the next season. In the redemption store, you can use points to redeem rich rewards, including power cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* Brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, three types of memberships will have corresponding different benefits (trial run stage, may change in the future); In S1 season, we will conduct a full-site standard battle pass free trial, hoping that everyone can use the free trial benefits of S1 to earn more points and redeem subsequent permanent benefits!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out loud.
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been expanded.
