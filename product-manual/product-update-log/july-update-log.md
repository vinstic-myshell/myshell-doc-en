# July Update Log

### 20230727

#### AutoPrompt Update

* Enhanced version of AutoPrompt is now available, which greatly improves the performance of role-playing and tool-type bots! 
* Bots can now set greeting messages! When using AutoPrompt, a greeting message will be automatically generated. You can edit it and add colorful gameplay introductions to the greeting message. Other users will see it when they click to chat with the bot.

#### Model Update

* Exclusive new model selection added: Non-English enhanced model: greatly improves the performance of GPT3.5 in non-English contexts! 
* GPT-4 model is now available for advanced members to use. If you haven't received advanced membership yet, come to the reward center to claim it! 
* Model temperature is now adjustable. As a creative adjuster for bots, you can adjust the temperature to make the bot's output more creative/predictable.

#### Bot Audio Experience Optimization

* Listening to bot voice default text will no longer consume battery power. 
* Bot reply audio will now follow the language set by the creator. No matter what language others input, they will hear the fixed language TTS effect.

#### Other Optimizations

* Translation function will be more stable with the language set by users on the platform. 
* Markdown rendering optimization. 
* NSFW bot isolation. The system will automatically detect and label bots containing NSFW content when saving them. NSFW bots are hidden by default in the workshop and can be turned on/off to view after confirming age.

* Redeemable prizes include: 
  1. Genesis Pass: Creator privileges, more private and public bots, support for using GPT-4 models, and more privileges! (For those who have received the Genesis Pass, please wait patiently. We will transfer it to your account within 7 days.)

  4. GPT-4 Chatting Package (600/300/150 power): A one-time charging item that can exceed the power limit, especially suitable for scenarios that require a lot of GPT-4 usage.

### 20230710

* Self-created bots now support uploading promotional images (up to 9) and backgrounds. You can introduce the gameplay examples of the bot in the image wall, making it easier for others to understand your work.

* Copying the entire text message is now supported when chatting with bots. 
* Prompt protection mechanism prompt optimization. 
* The reward center now offers Discord active point redemption! You can connect your Discord account to the platform and receive points based on your activity level.

Use the "/level" command to check your current level and the number of messages needed to level up.

Major update: Reward Center and new membership system

* MyShell point system is now online, and we will use the point season system to allow everyone to play and earn on the platform! The first season will start from July 1, 2023, at 0:00 (UTC-4) to July 15, 2023, at 23:59 (UTC-4). You can earn a lot of points by completing tasks in the first 12 days of the season. Although point redemption is not yet available, all task completion rates will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate them when we open point redemption! 
* Three days before the end of the season, we will open the point redemption mall. At the same time, the season points will no longer be available, and new points earned from completing tasks will accumulate for the next season. In the redemption mall, you can use points to redeem rich rewards, including power cards, our new membership card, and even the Genesis Pass! 
* New membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass. The three memberships will have different privileges (trial run stage, subject to change in the future). In S1 season, we will offer a free trial of the Standard Battle Pass for the entire site. We hope that everyone can use the S1 free trial to earn more points and redeem more long-term privileges!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out by voice. 
* Character input limit in bot description has been expanded.
