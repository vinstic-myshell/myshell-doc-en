# MyShell Points System (Alpha)

The MyShell Points System is a member incentive system that is only open to advanced members and Genesis Pass holders, to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits for themselves while learning and entertaining on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will follow the points season system to refresh tasks and rewards, with each season lasting about 15 days and task refresh and season change taking place according to the UTC-4 time zone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn massive points by completing tasks, including daily conversations, MyShell innovative feature experiences, education bot check-ins, social media participation, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which point earning will temporarily stop, and the top 10% of users will receive an additional 5% points bonus! You can redeem the points earned in each season for rich rewards, including power cards, limited-time access to public robots, advanced membership cards, and even Genesis Passes. The remaining points can also be used to redeem season-specific medals, which serve as proof of eligibility for future airdrops. Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* The advanced membership card is globally free during this season, and we hope that everyone can earn more membership benefits for themselves while enjoying the free benefits.
* Reward redemption:
  1. Genesis Pass: Creator benefits, more private robots, special privileges for public robots, support for using the GPT-4 model for creation, and more benefits! (For those who have obtained the Genesis Pass, please be patient, we will transfer the Pass to your account within 7 days after casting.)
  2. Advanced membership card (1 month): You can redeem 1 month of advanced membership (which can be stacked) after the membership fee is paid (expected within three months), suitable for ordinary users who are not creators.
  3. S1 commemorative medal: A season-exclusive medal that will soon be cast into an NFT and can serve as proof of eligibility for future airdrops.
  4. GPT-4 chat package (600 power/300 power/150 power): A prop that can be used for one-time charging, which can exceed the power limit and is especially suitable for scenarios that require a large amount of GPT-4 usage.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)

* The advanced membership card can be obtained for free in the store and lasts for the entire season. We still hope that everyone has enough benefits to accumulate longer membership periods in the future.
* The season introduces a new player welfare, where you can exchange 300 power for only 10 points to experience more!
