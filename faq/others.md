#### What is the difference between Telegram's bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first demo bot and the birthplace of our entire project. However, as the requirements for accessibility and membership systems have become increasingly high, Telegram can no longer meet the needs of our users. Therefore, we have developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, Telegram's bot will be positioned for new users' quick experience and limited to fewer conversations. The web version will provide a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an app version?

An app will definitely be released, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The boundaries of AIGC's review are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a contingency plan that can provide some services as a backup.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still gradually improving. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md "mention").

#### Can I play on Discord and the bot?

Currently, Discord does not have voice information, so only the customer service support robot [#ethan-or-support](../product-manual/robot-introduction.md#ethan-or-support "mention") is provided.

#### How to get MyShell Genesis Pass?

There are several ways to get the limited 10,000 MyShell Genesis Pass:

The builders channel requires an introduction of yourself in the Apply-to-join channel and pass the review.

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of effective invitations?

Effective invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually given top priority. The score measurement of this contribution degree will be traced back to three layers after the effective invitation, so even if you do not have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to users' subsequent behaviors, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

Effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as effective invitations.

In order to prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be made public. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to understand. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.

#### Are there more project introductions?

Docs ([https://docs.myshell.ai/](https://docs.myshell.ai/)) provides introductions to all aspects of the project and is constantly updated. You can go there to check.
