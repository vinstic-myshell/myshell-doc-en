# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is Whisper API used?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper's if you compare them.

#### Is GPT used for Q&A? Is it based on ChatGPT? Is it GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) currently, and we plan to integrate GPT-4 in some advanced features. At the same time, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is already in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS (text-to-speech) model, and currently, the English TTS supports fast voice cloning, which can clone anyone's voice with only 1-5 minutes of voice samples.

MyShell's TTS has the feature of being closer to human pronunciation than other products on the market, as well as faster response time and lower computing costs. Currently, the technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
