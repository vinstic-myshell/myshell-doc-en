# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is Whisper API used?

We use our own Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, which has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper.

#### Is GPT used for Q&A? Is it based on ChatGPT? Is it GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the chatbot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT), and we plan to integrate GPT-4 in some advanced features. At the same time, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS (text-to-speech) model, and the English TTS currently supports fast voice cloning, which can clone anyone's voice with only 1-5 minutes of voice samples.

MyShell's TTS has the feature of being closer to human pronunciation than other products on the market, as well as faster response time and lower computing costs. Currently, voice technology for different emotions is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
